# LLM Engineering Course

Currently following the [LLM Engineering course](https://www.udemy.com/course/llm-engineering-master-ai-and-large-language-models/) 
by [Ed Donner](https://edwarddonner.com) on Udemy, I wanted to push the exercises that I made in GitHub, not entirely sure why yet.
I like this course very much so far (this has been written after week 1, ask me again in 7 weeks üòÅ)

### Little known facts
1. I am a total n00b at Python, this is also my Python playground
2. I have quite some experience in strictly typed and compiled languages (C++, Java, Kotlin), 
so I will most probably bring this experience in the way I write code here, which might upset hard core Python devs. 
Sorry about that :) 
3. I really find this "new" (to me) world absolutely amazing and fascinating, but I am also very much learning!
So if anyone stumble upon this and find horrible things, please don't hesitate to let me know.

### Week 1 Exercise
During the first week we have discovered how to communicate with the OpenAI apis as well as a local LLama running on the 
computer. 

The exercise was basically to create an assistant that answers Code specific questions, and ask the question on both 
OpenAI APIs and local running llm.

My approach was to create an initial version of a communication "library" which contains class that can make it simple 
to use for asking a question to those two LLMs, regardless of how to contact them.

I hope this approach is liked.
